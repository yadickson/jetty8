<h1>Welcome to Jetty 8 on Debian</h1>

<P align="justify">
<b>Jetty</b> is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container.  This means
that you do not need to configure and run a seperate web server (like Apache)
in order to use java, servlets and JSPs to generate dynamic content. Jetty
is a fully featured web server for static and dynamic content. Unlike separate
server/container solutions, this means that your web server and web application
run in the same process, without interconnection overheads and complications.
Furthermore, as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply included in your
application for demonstration, distribution or deployment. Jetty is available
on all Java supported platforms. &nbsp;</p>
